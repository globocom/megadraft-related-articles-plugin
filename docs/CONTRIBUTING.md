## Contribution Scope

This repository's goal is to provide a laboratory for people worldwide to learn more about cybersecurity and secure development. With that in mind, we expect contributions such as new applications, tweaks on the ones already existing or a bug catch.

To build some of the Megadraft Plugin, some third party code, such as libraries or Content Management Systems (CMS), was used. Improving and maintaining external code is not the goal of this project and, in this regard, all contributions on that matter will be considered invalid.

## So... I built this app, it looks great, but how can I send it to Megadraft Plugin?

Well, a good place to start is to make sure you can deploy your app with Docker-Compose. All the apps in Megadraft Plugin are built with it in order to ensure you can get right into the action! If you need help, make sure to check [Docker Compose Getting Started] and [Compose File Reference] for a detailed look at `docker-compose.yml` file structure. ‚úì

So your app can be deployed with Docker-Compose, nice job! But wait, does it have a Makefile?, we have a template you can follow or you can create your own! ‚úì
